# OCT_Microscopy_Hybrid_Stage
Automated Multi-Angle OCT &amp; Microscopy Sample Stage  UC Riverside – Bioengineering Senior Design Project | Team O

This project focuses on developing a fully automated dual-axis rotational stage designed to improve imaging precision, efficiency, and reproducibility in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and microscopy applications. Traditional sample positioning systems rely on manual manipulation, which introduce alignment errors, slow down imaging workflows, and limit multi-angle analysis.
